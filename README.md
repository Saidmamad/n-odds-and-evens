# n-odds-and-evens
Problem: finding n number of even and odds and displaying them

Requirements:

1.	it should display EQUAL (specified by n) number of odds and evens;
2.	should display the count of odds/evens and along with the series;
3.	If you change the start point, it should still output equal numbers;
4.	it should not put comma at the end;

How would you solve it shorter and more efficient?
